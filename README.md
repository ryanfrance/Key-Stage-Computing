Key Stage Coding - A web based E-Learning environment; aiding primary school pupils in learning the new Computing curriculum

This project has been started to fulfil client specifications for my final year project at university.

However through the research element of my project I found statistical concerns among IT teachers; 74% of ICT teachers felt unprepared and unable to deliver the practical skills needed to teach this new subject.(MyKindaCrowd, 2013)
In the same survey, a whopping 96% of teachers surveyed expressed a demand for third party tools to support the learning process.

For a long time I have felt a lacking in the IT curriculum, things like programming and software engineering have always taken a back seat amongst learning skills in business tools.

SOOOO I decided to make this project public, it doesnt take much to test it or install it.

- Just fork or download a copy into your favourite LAMP production server. Or upload a copy to a web server.
- Browse to it and run.

As features get added I will update info as needed. The administrator account details are stored in the admin_readme.txt within the folder.
